    "*Question 1): Explain the difference between map, filter, and reduce.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:Even though all of them are built-in higher order functions their differences are the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "map: It uses its first input as a function and apply it to every element of the second iterable input. It will return the same type of output as the second input.\n",
    "\n",
    "filter: Same as map but the difference here is that it will return boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "reduce: same as map but it does not return an iterable, it will return a single value based on the fist input function\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question 2): Explain the difference between higher order function, closure and decorator.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "higher order function: Can take as an input one or more function and is called like it would in a normal function. (of course one of the inputs is a function)\n",
    "\n",
    "closure: closure is created by nesting a function inside another encapsulating function and then returning the inner function same as the higher order function but\n",
    "\n",
    "decorators: Same as higher order function but using a @function before the input function you dont have to actually define explicitly the higher order function. \n"
